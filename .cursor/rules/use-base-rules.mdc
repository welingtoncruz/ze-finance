# Use Base Development Rules

All AI agents working on this project must follow the comprehensive development rules and guidelines defined in:

**📋 [base-standards.mdc](./base-standards.mdc)**

## Key Directive

- **Single Source of Truth**: All development rules, coding standards, testing practices, and workflow requirements are maintained in `base-standards.mdc`
- **No Rule Duplication**: Do not reference or follow other rule files - `base-standards.mdc` contains the complete and authoritative rule set
- **Always Current**: `base-standards.mdc` is the actively maintained configuration - other rule files may be outdated

## What's Included in base-standards.mdc

- **Core Principles**: Small tasks one at a time, Test-Driven Development (TDD), type safety, clear naming, incremental changes
- **Language Standards**: English-only requirement for all technical artifacts
- **Specific Standards**: Links to detailed standards for:
  - Backend development (API, database patterns, testing, security)
  - Frontend development (React components, UI/UX guidelines)
  - Documentation (structure, formatting, maintenance)

## Compliance

Before starting any development work, agents must:
1. Read and understand all rules in `base-standards.mdc`
2. Follow the TDD process and core principles defined there
3. Use the specified tools, testing frameworks, and standards
4. Maintain the required code quality and type safety standards
5. Refer to specific standards documents (backend, frontend, documentation) for detailed guidelines

**Remember**: `base-standards.mdc` is the complete development rulebook for this project.
